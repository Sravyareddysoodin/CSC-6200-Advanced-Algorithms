# Week 1 â€“ Project Indices (Two Sum)

## Files
- **two_sum.cpp**: Initial brute-force style solution using arrays.  
- **revision.cpp**: Optimized solution implemented with a hash map inside `class Solution`, O(n) time complexity.

## Notes
The assignment was a warm-up on arrays. The revision demonstrates a more advanced approach applying prior algorithm knowledge.
